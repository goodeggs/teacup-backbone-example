! Using Teacup with Backbone - an example app

This app runs a node server with Express and connect-assets to serve a basic Backbone.js app that demonstrates
how to use Teacup in your Backbone apps.

Express serves up the one HTML page and connect-assets compiles and combines the JavaScript and CSS,
very similarly to Rails and it's asset pipeline. If you're already using Rails and Backbone, you should
be able to use Teacup exactly as demonstrated in this app.
